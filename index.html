Today is your day, but honestly, I feel like I’m the lucky one for having you in my life.

This past year wasn’t easy for you.
You went through so many things, problems here and there, moments that could’ve made anyone give up.
Last year might’ve been one of the hardest chapters in your life.

But what amazes me the most is how you didn’t stay down.

You stood back up.
You changed.
You grew.

And now, seeing you today feels like watching someone who turned their life around completely… like a full 180°.
You’re stronger, wiser, and becoming such an amazing person.

I’m really proud of you. More than you probably realize.

I’m sorry if the gift I gave you isn’t much.
I wish I could give you something bigger, something better, something that truly shows how much you mean to me.

But what I truly want to give you isn’t just a gift.

I want to give you my time, my support, my loyalty, and my presence as we continue growing through life together.

I don’t just want to celebrate your birthday today.
I want to be there for every chapter of your life ahead.

Let’s keep growing together.
Let’s keep learning together.
Let’s keep choosing each other, again and again.

Happy 24th birthday, my love.

I’m so proud of you.
And I’m grateful to walk through life with you. ❤️`;
